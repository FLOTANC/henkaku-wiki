# For Git Contributors（English）
## Resources to help you get started with Git.
- [初心者向けGithubへのPullRequest方法 - Qiita（日本語）](https://qiita.com/samurai_runner/items/7442521bce2d6ac9330b)
- [Creating a pull request（English）](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
- [Markdown Cheatsheet（English）](https://qiita.com/samurai_runner/items/7442521bce2d6ac9330b)

## Update documentation using Git

- When you update [Github repository](https://github.com/henkaku-center/henkaku-wiki), it will be reflected in the documentation automatically (about 5 minutes)
- When you make changes to the documentation, please send us a pull request. If you need a review, please request one.
- English documentation should be placed in the top directory, and Japanese documentation should be placed under the `ja` directory as a `markdown file with the same name`

```
> `ja/` ⇦  Japanese files
> `notes/`
> `README.md`
> `home.md` ⇦  English files
```

- We also have a `notes` directory for light documentation in each directory
- You can fork the repository and push your changes to your own repository without having to get permissions from the administrator. Then you can send a pull request
- If you want permission to edit the repository, please request access in the `#✍│documentation` channel

## Edit Wiki.js directly

- You can edit documentation directly in Wiki.js without sending a pull request to GitHub
- If you want to edit Wiki.js, please request access on the `#✍│documentation` channel!
